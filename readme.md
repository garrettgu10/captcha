This is a little web-app that facilitates the process of proving that you're not a robot through traditional communication means.
<br>First, a user who wishes to prove that they're not a robot goes to <a href="https://team5212.com/captcha/">https://team5212.com/captcha/</a> to solve a captcha and generate a random, single-use key. 
<br>This user then sends the key to someone else, who inputs it on <a href="https://team5212.com/captcha/checkKey.php">https://team5212.com/captcha/checkKey.php</a> and verifies the validity of the key. If the key is valid, the user has successfully proven that they are not a robot. 
<br>This is important: after the key has been verified, it is promptly destroyed. Therefore, any attempt to search for a valid key results in the immediate invalidation of the key.
